## Note:

Something to note:

* One big piece of this lab is to use RMarkdown to write a report that really 
  integrates text with code and graphics and tables that are generated by 
  RMarkdown. Use the fact that you can easily check your answers to the specific 
  questions to give you some freedom to think about how you want to present your 
  answers. Don't just copy and paste from my answers, but think about how you 
  would use RMarkdown to present your answers in your own way.

## The Assignment:

There are two files for this lab.

1. Start by reading [`lab-04-instructions.pdf`](lab-04-instructions.pdf), 
   (online version [`lab-04-instructions.md`](lab-04-instructions.md) on 
   GitHub) which describes things you need to know for this lab (about the R
   functions for working with the RRTM model and the data that it produces, as
   well as some new enhancements to working with MODTRAN and techniques for
   using the R `ifelse` function to adjust the text of your report when you run
   it with new data.)

   This file also describes and explains the exercises you will do for this lab.

2. When you come to lab, you will work through the exercises, and you will
   edit the file `lab-04-report.Rmd` to write your answers and show your
   work.

   Something I would like you to do as you work through the exercises for this
   lab is to think about integrating your text and code, so you describe what
   you are going to do with your data, then have a chunk of R code that does
   what you just described, and is followed by more text that discusses the
   results or the next steps, depending on where you are in the process.

## Instructions:

* Accept this assignment.
* Clone a local copy of the file repository from GitHub to your
  own computer.
* In your local repository, answer the exercises in the template
  `lab-04-report.Rmd`.
* When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` files into PDF files.
* Use git to commit your changes (including the edits to the `.Rmd` files
  and the new PDF files) to your local git repository.
* Push the changes from your local git repository to GitHub.

  The last changes that you push before the due date
  (9:00 AM Wednesday Feb. 23) will be graded. If you run into 
  difficulty and need extra time, please contact Mr. Belanger or Prof. Gilligan.

I advise using git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those 
commits to GitHub.

I also advise knitting your answers frequently to make sure that they
knit correctly.
